# first project on recursion is Factorials
# Factorial of a number n is defined as a product of all positive descending integers, Factorial of n is denoted by n!. Factorial can be calculated using the following recursive formula where the recursive call is made to a multiplicity of all the numbers lesser than the number for which the factorial is computed as the formula to calculate factorial is as shown in the code.
